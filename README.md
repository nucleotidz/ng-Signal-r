SingalR is one of the technology that intrests me , unfortunately i never get a chance to work on it in any software project , but at i  felt a strong need of it in my projects which involves polling the server for real time data processing. The web project i am working on now a days is on Angular JS , WEB API , ASP.NET MVC . I have done some POC's for my learning on SignalR with .net cliens and ASP.NET , i wanted to experince how it works in Single page App, i went through a lot of articles on internet but every article confused me , so i decided to write a simple app by myself . 
The idea of the app here is there are two pages one shows the details of the user accounts in a grid and another creates new account in the system. If a user A is on the details page doing some stuff there at the same time another user B from adds a new account in the system user A shuld get it immediately without page refresh . To achive this i use following tecnolgies

1. ASP.NET MVC for View Rendering
2. Angular JS for Presentation
3. WEB API for CRUD operation 
4. SignalR for live updates 
5. Boostrap for UI/UX
